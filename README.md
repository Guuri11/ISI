# ISI

ISI is a highly advanced artificial intelligence system designed to provide assistance and facilitate interactive interactions. With its machine learning capability and wide range of features, ISI becomes an invaluable ally for complex tasks and decision-making processes.

### 🏆️ Motivation
Looking for a way to build a smart assistant that helps me with some tasks, decisions, or lets me do things faster.

Why ISI? ISI was my cat that passed away some time ago, so this is kind of a dedication to it.


## 📽️ Demo
Not the best video/audio quality, but good enough for the POC (audio in spanish)

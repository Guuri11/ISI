UI and state:

- `components/`: reusable UI components.
- `assets/`: images, icons, fonts, global.css.
- `lib/`: hooks, stores (Zustand), state machines (XState), utilities.
- `router/`: navigation.

#### UI design system

The design is initially based on [React Native Reusables](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app), which is based on [NativeWind](https://nativewindui.com/) and [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

#### How to change theme app

This skeleton is based on RNR & shadcn/ui. So just follow the shadcn/ui guide in [Shadcn/ui themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes), customize, copy the code & paste it at [global.css](./assets/global.css)

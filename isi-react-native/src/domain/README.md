## 📁 src/domain

Domain models and contracts.

- `exceptions/`: error factory and management.
- `models/`: entities and domain objects.
- `repositories/`: data access interfaces.
- `usecases/`: definition of use cases to maintain traceability from the domain.

Keep **framework-free**. Only pure business logic and models.
